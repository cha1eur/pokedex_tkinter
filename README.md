# pokedex_tkinter
This program was created by Javier Ewe.
This is just a cool personal summer project to practice my Python 3 skills!
Sample size of 10 Pokemon used Pictures obtained from Bulbapedia
This is a Pokemon Encyclopedia made with Tkinter for Python, where one can search for pokemon via the Pokedex number or through a drop down menu. 
Note this program was made from a Windows Computer and WILL look different when loaded on MacOS or Linux. 
Please excuse any formatting errors as a result of non-Windows computers being used to load this program. 
Note for Tkinter to accept my .png files, please use Python 3.6 or newer on Windows or Python 3.7(b) or later on Mac. Thanks!
